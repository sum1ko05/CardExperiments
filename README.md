# CardExperiments
Just a stash for expirements with cards and algorhitms.

This repo is just stash of various experiments with card games in algorhitms.
Any code here probably would be used for future projects and would be rewritten in other languages, if i have to.

**IMPORTANT!** Keep in mind that it's not stable project at all, so reorganisations would be often here!

Currently working on implementation of Poker

### Dependencies
Libraries doesn't depend on external packages

Apps would depend on some graphic package - now deciding what package i would use
